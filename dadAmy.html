		<h1>Merry Christmas Dad and Amy!</h1>
		<h2>A story for a wintry night..</h2>
        <p>It was a few nights before Christmas,<br>and all through the house,<br>not a neuron was firing,<br>until!<br>
        The son realized he hadn't ordered gifts off the internet!<br>
    rather than frantically one day shipping,<br>
he decided to try out something new.<br><br>Thus, this webpage was born, a monument to his (lack of) time management skills.</br>
I love you both, and I'm fortunate to have you in my life.  I hope your Christmas is wonderful,<br>and Santa brings you everything you could ever want.</p>
<h2>Your gift:</h2>
<p>One (1) dinner or lunch of your choice, compliments of aforementioned son.</p>
<h3>Love,<br>Dylan</h3>
