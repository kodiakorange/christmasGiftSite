		<h1>Merry Christmas Trent!</h1>
		<h2>A Tale For a Brother</h2>
		<p>
			Once upon a time, there was a family absolutely riddled with mental illnesses,<br />yet even among such a
			family, two brothers stood out for their inability to process time.<br />Their names? Trenton and Dylan.<br />
			Forged in the fires of forgetting basically everything all the time,<br />one might think they would
			eventually learn to cope. And yet...<br />In spite of this, brother Trenton was able to accomplish
			incredible things,<br />and make incredible impacts on people he met throughout his journey,<br />and the
			world was better off for having him a part of it.<br />
			I love you so much man, and it has been so incredible watching you grow up over the years. I'm so lucky to
			be a part of your life, and I can't wait to see you again soon.
