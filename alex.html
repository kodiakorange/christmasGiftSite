		<h1>Merry Christmas Alex<br />(the only levelheaded Kriz that has ever lived)</h1>
		<h2>A story..</h2>
		<p>
			I cannot believe how fortunate Austin and the kids are to have you a part of their lives<br />Let alone
			me<br />
			If it weren't for your kindness I never would have even made it to Atlanta, and everything good in my life
			that has come of that move is a direct result of said kindness. There aren't enough words for me to fully
			convey the amount of respect and love I have for you. To see someone in your position not only keep her
			cool, but radiate calm to those around her? At times it's hard for my broken brain to understand, but I know
			that we are all better off having you in this world. I love you, I love your sense of style, and I love the
			love and kindness you show to those around you.<br />Merry Christmas Alex, here's to a hundred more.
		</p>
		<h3>Your gift:</h3>
		<p>
			Any two (2) candles, from anywhere in the world. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that you know best
			what it is you want so you'll have to send me the links. Cheers!
