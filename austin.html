		<h1>Merry Christmas Brother Austin <br />(may he reign 1000 years)</h1>
		<h3>A poem for a dealsmith</h3>
		<p>It was the 12th month of the year 2023</p>
		<p>Uncharacteristically, Dylan found himself slightly behind schedule on his amazon orders</p>
		<p>He then thought, hey, what if I actually put effort into something?</p>
		<p>It was the first time such an idea had even crossed his mind,</p>
		<p>
			but something inside him said yes! <br />this was a chance to go against his base nature, <br />a chance to
			apply himself! <br />to find the reward that only comes from the steady application of effort! <br />(And
			also maybe add it to his portfolio one day.)
		</p>
		<p>Ergo, what you are reading at this very moment.</p>
		<h4>
			I am so, so, so fortunate to have you as my brother. I would not be where I am, or honestly even here at
			all, if it weren't for everything you've done for me over the years. You're an incredible brother, and
			incredible husband, and an incredible father. I love you man.
