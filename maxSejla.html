		<h1>Merry Christmas Max and Sejla!</h1>
		<h2>A few words for some dear friends..</h2>
		<p>
			I have been so, so, fortunate to know the two of you.<br />My life has been better having met you, and I
			know I'm not the only person who can say that.<br />Your kindness, intelligence, beauty<br />(I mean it you
			two are truly gorgeous people it makes sense how you ended up together) are just some of the qualities that
			make you so incredible.<br />Watching you both advance in your careers while remaining the same fun people I
			met years ago has been such a privilege, and I can't wait until I get to see you again.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Merry Christmas, I love you guys, and I can't wait until we're partying together again.<br /><br />Until
			then,<br /><br />
			Dylan
